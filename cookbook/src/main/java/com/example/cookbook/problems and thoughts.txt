all beans add DTO and use model mapper


thought:
version control
    //When updating a recipe, 
    //user can choose to over write recipe or add new version/copy so he can go back
    //name title + today date+ version, 
    //can pick the prefered version that would be viewed (isPrefered)
    //all where title like "%Title", are all the versions

CASCADE relationship with connected table
    //when deleting an ingredient? - nothing, shouldnt happened
    //when deleting a recipe all recipe ingredient would be deleted- ALL
    //when deleting a recipe ingredient - nothing

only Admin?
adding ingredient
update Ingredient prices
