version control
    //When updating a recipe, 
    //user can choose to over write recipe or add new version/copy so he can go back
    //name title + today date+ version, 
    //can pick the prefered version that would be viewed (isPrefered)
    //all where title like "%Title", are all the versions 
        >> need to be with where user_id = id, if want user to be able to copy and edit other users recipies

future
working login
- user can't update other user recipe
- user can copy user recipe

admin can edit all
- adding ingredient
- update Ingredient prices
